`You can either make things happen, or let things happen. I prefer the first one. 
`

A movie with a boring plot is no fun to watch. Similarly, a life without adventure, risk, and new things to do every day become boring. I adapt things when required, cross the bridge when I get there. A firm determination that, “It was inevitable to get what I had thought of, but it’s just the time which has not yet come”, till the moment I achieve it, keep myself moving.

Currently I am enrolled in a PhD with the main focus on Artificial Intelligence. My supervisor is Prof. Thomas Serre, Brown University, USA. My research interests include topics related to Computer Vision, Neural Networks and Machine Learning. I am currently working on modeling attention and mnemonic mechanism inspired by biological systems.
