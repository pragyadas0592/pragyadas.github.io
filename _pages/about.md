You can either make things happen, or let things happen. I prefer the first one. 

A movie with a boring plot is no fun to watch. Similarly, a life without adventure, risk, and new things to do every day become boring. I adapt things when required, cross the bridge when I get there. A firm determination that, “It was inevitable to get what I had thought of, but it’s just the time which has not yet come”, till the moment I achieve it, keep myself moving.
