# An Optimal Switched Adaptive Prediction Method for Lossless Video Coding
[Download paper here](http://vaishnavmohit.github.io/files/paper2.pdf)

In this work, we propose a method of lossless video coding which not only has the decoder simple but
the encoder is also simple, unlike other reported methods which has computationally complex encoder.
