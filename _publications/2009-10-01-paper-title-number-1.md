# A Novel Computationally Efficient Motion Compensation Method Based on Pixel by Pixel Prediction
[Download paper here](http://vaishnavmohit.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)

We proposed an efficient method for finding motion compensated frames by matching pixels rather than
conventional method based on block matching. This matching is done in a feedback manner using only
causal neighborhood pixels of the pixel to be matched.
